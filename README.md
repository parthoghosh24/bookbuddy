Bookbuddy
=========

Bookbuddy was my attempt to create an EPUB reader. The goal of the project was simple:

-> List epubs available (Need to be in a particular folder, didn't go for a system wide search)
-> Open and process Epub for reading purpose.
-> Very basic UI. Minimal controls provided to user so that user can read the book. Lots of the stuff not done
   such as page swiping, page break, font management and font coloring.

Used chaek(http://code.google.com/p/chaek/) as reference to build this reader. It was fun and learned alot.
